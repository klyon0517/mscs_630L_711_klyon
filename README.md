# Spring 2022 Security Algorithms &amp; Protocols

This project combines the AES encryption process with animation in the Babylon.js web
rendering engine. Titled “BabylonAES”, the goal is to provide a real time 3D visualization of how
AES encryption works from plaintext and system key inputs to the ciphertext output. Various
plane meshes with dynamic textures displaying hex values are grouped and positioned around
a virtual scene. They are updated and become visible depending on which function and method
is occurring at that particular point in time. A camera is placed in the center of the scene
allowing end users to rotate, zoom, and pan around the scene freely from any angle in real time.
